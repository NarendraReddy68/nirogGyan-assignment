# Healthcare Appointment Booking Web Application

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to view doctor profiles and book appointments. It consists of a **React.js frontend** and a **Node.js + Express backend**, with a SQLite database used for data storage.

Improvements with More Time

If given additional time, I would work on the following enhancements to improve the functionality and user experience of the healthcare appointment booking system:

User Authentication System: Implement secure login/signup for patients and doctors with role-based access control.

Search & Filters: Improve search functionality with filters like availability, specialization, fees range, and ratings.

Rating & Review System: Allow patients to rate doctors and leave feedback after consultations.



Challenges Faced and Solutions

During development, I encountered a few key challenges:

Database Integration: Fetching data dynamically from the backend and displaying it correctly on the frontend required precise API design.
Solution: Created clean RESTful APIs with Express.js and handled asynchronous operations using async/await.

Bug with Multiple Doctor Names Displaying on Booking Page: Initially, clicking on a doctor showed all doctors' names instead of the selected one.
Solution: Isolated the state of the selected doctor properly and ensured only that doctorâ€™s data was passed to the BookAppointmentPage.

Responsiveness: Designing a fully responsive layout that looks good on both desktop and mobile took time.
Solution: Used media queries and flex layouts with normal CSS to ensure consistency across devices.

Responsive Design Enhancements: Fine-tune the UI for better responsiveness and accessibility across all screen sizes.
